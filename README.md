# Ray Tracing with Trimesh and Vedo

### Goals
 - render a scene with user-defined meshes with the ray tracing method
 - shade the mesh with the Blinn-Phong model
 - implement vector rendering

### Running
The included driver is a quick demonstration of how the program works.
Make sure that Vedo, Trimesh, and Embreex are installed.

### Further Improvements
- add support for multiple meshes in one scene
- write a *fast_shading* vector-based function to speed up the shading
- simple GUI to describe transformations and display
